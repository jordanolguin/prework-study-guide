# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The motivation for this project was to aid future bootcamp students in their studies by creating an aesthetic, easy-to-use webpage to compile information learned throughout the prework. I built this project to create a solid area to house all of the information taught in the bootcamp prework module as well as provide the opportunity for bootcamp students to add thier own notes and become more comfortable with these new coding languages. This project eliminates any messy study folders or notebooks with it's clear and concise set up. It also provides a playground for new bootcamp students to experiment with the new coding languages by offering the space to customize, add, subtract and explore the topics covered in the prework module. In creating this project, I learned basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GIT, and DevTools Console languages and techniques. I also learned how to debug, troubleshoot and reverse-engineer code.
